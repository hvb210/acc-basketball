# ACC Basketball Analysis

This project analyzes scoring data from ACC men’s basketball conference games during the 2025–2026 season.  
The goal is to explore how points are distributed among players and teams and to visualize scoring patterns.

- What share of team scoring comes from top scorers?  
- Which teams are more “top-heavy” in scoring vs. balanced?  
- Are there any trends or patterns in scoring across the season?
- Is there any difference in shooting statistics based on venue?
- Which teams are better at defending three-point shots?
